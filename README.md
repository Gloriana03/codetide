- 🎯 **Small projects** — focused experiments and micro builds
- 🧪 **Testing work** — unit, integration & automation practice
- 🌱 **Occasional backend logic** — mainly in Python, C/C# or Java

## 💬 Final Note

This space is more than just code, it’s a stream of intention, built one wave at a time.  
Whether it's a single script or a full application, each project echoes where I’ve been,and where I’m going.
